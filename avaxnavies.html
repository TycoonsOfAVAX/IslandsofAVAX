							<h2>Islands of AVAX Expansion - Master of the Seas</h2>
							<p>
								Master of the Seas expansion introduces naval combat mechanics to the archipelago region and offers players a chance to Play2Earn. 
								Command your fleet of warships and participate in Player vs Environment (PvE) missions or join up with a company or faction and be part of a formidable armada. 
								Participate in massive faction vs faction battles where the outcome will direct the game storyline and determine the face of the archipelago region.
								Do you have what it takes to become the Master of the Seas in the Archipelago region? 
							</p>
							<h4>How fleet strength is calculated for each wallet (Alpha Combat Simulation):</h4>
							<p>
								<strong>1 Naval Vessel + 1 Island = 1 Active Naval Unit (ANU)</strong>
							<br>
							<br>
								Each mission will have a ANU threshold. 
								Players sign their wallet to participate in the mission before the deadline. 
								Snapshot is taken at deadline and ANU of each registered player is tallied to determine if requirement is met. 
								Payout is paid out based on each player's % portion of total ANU.
							</p>

							<p>
								New missions and faction mechanics are organized over the Islands of AVAX Discord channel.

					<h2 class="major"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
					<div class="container">
						<button class="accordion">WHAT ARE MISSIONS?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Missions are team challenges within the Islands of AVAX + AVAX Navies ecosystem where players are invited to work together to meet certain requirements by a certain deadline. Rewards are given out to participants should the players meet the team threshold requirements. Some missions are activity based (eg. Share a joke on discord) while others are wallet based (eg. Collectively own 20 naval vessels + 20 islands) 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT IS A BATTLE CONTRACT?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Each wallet based mission consists of a BATTLE CONTRACT where players wishing to participate must register by signing with their wallet. Only registered players' assets will be counted towards the threshold requirement and only registered player wallets will be awarded prizes. Signing the BATTLE CONTRACT for one mission does not automatically enroll you for the next mission, you must register for each mission to be counted towards each challenge. 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT ARE ACTIVE NAVAL UNIT POINTS?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Naval Unit calculation occurs at the player level and consists of having a naval vessel and an island for resupply/docking. For alpha simulation, 1 naval vessel + 1 island in your wallet = 1 ANU. The more ANU you bring to a battle, the bigger your reward will be when your team meets the requirement for a mission. In future battle contracts we will be taking into consideration ship type, crew experience and your naval rank to give boosters to your ANU. 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WEN MINT?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Minting starts Nov 30th starting at 0.5 AVAX per vessel. Players can mint up to 20 vessels per transaction. We also have VIP mint for anyone who graduated from the Naval academy navy-bootcamp-canteen. 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT'S WITH THE ORIGINS, MASCOTS AND EXPERIENCE LEVEL?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Currently they are just there to give some storytelling element to them. In the future, we may have missions where the BATTLE CONTRACT boosts the ANU value of units with select qualifying traits (Eg. Elites count as X% ANU power boost or Vikings Origin ships gain Y% ANU boost in the upcoming missions that involves raiding)
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">HOW DO I RANKUP?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Players can advance in their naval officer ranking through growing their ANU score with top players receiving the rank of Admiral, Vice Admiral and Rear Admiral. Admirals can initiate new missions and are expected to mobilize players to participate in missions. Their reward can range from a guarantee minimum % of the mission's pool to unique NFT loots which they may offer as rewards to outstanding team members.						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">CAN I TEAM UP WITH FRIENDS AND FORM A RAIDING PARTY?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Naval units are compatible with the companies within the Archipelago region. If a company can achieve 30 ANU (may change), the company can request a company mission (eg. Provide 'protection services' to a Governor's District) 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">HOW DO I GET PAID? </button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							There are 4 ways to get in game reward tokens (AVAX or any specified in game reward tokens). PvP battles, Boss fights, Officer commissions and Shipbuilder contractor. 						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">How much can I make?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							<strong>Note that AVAX NAVIES NFT series is first and foremost an artistic NFT collection and <u>not an investment or security of any form.</u></strong> 
							Players who participate in the simulation do so because they love the NFT arts and want to be part of the combat simulation that goes with it. 
							One should not be expecting to make any returns from this game.
