											<h2>About the Islands of AVAX</h2>
											<p>Ready to be collected and traded</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Islands of AVAX is an archipelago of islands rich full of untapped resources and  developmental opportunites. Island cities are eager for food and resources and there are research rich islands waiting to be collected.
											Will you preserve their natural beauty or will you build industries to meet the growing needs of the island cities?

										<h2 class="major"><span>Backstory</span></h2>
										<p>
											With the success of development programs AVALANACHE RUSH bringing in massive growth to the lands of AVAX, the people of AVAX found themselves with the issue of getting enough resources to fuel and power the rapid development. With the mainland region fully developed and the high cost of ETH gas fees making it hard to import resources, the administration of President Emin Gün Sirer has decided to turn their focus to developing the island archipelago region of AVAX. 
											</p><p>
											Codenamed Island Rush, the program is aimed at developing the undeveloped and resource rich island archipelago region which is in dire need of development and bridging. Plans for new cities have been drawn up and industrialist/builders from all around the world are invited to partake in the great development project. 
											Many have answered the call of President Emin Gün Sirer from industrialists looking bid on islands to start new ventures all the way to working families eager to relocate to new cities and work the resource rich islands. Large multinational conglomerates such as the GB Group and Ape Inc. are making plans to become dominant players in the region. 
										</p><p>
											Whether you are building bridges to toll, developing industries on the islands, managing needs at population centers or running for governor, there are many of opportunities for anyone to establish themselves at the Islands of AVAX.
