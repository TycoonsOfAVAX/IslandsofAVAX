											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium imp-medium">
												<h3>A prosperious region</h3>
											<p>												
												The AVAXpelago region is rich in resources and has been the prized colony of the AVAX Kingdom. With a constant inflow of settlers and development support from the home country, AVAXpelago has developed into a prosperious colony within the northern hemisphere. Sadly, all good times  However this prosperity was short lived.  
												Without provocation, the aggressive Nation of FIATland invaded AVAX homeland alongisde with the AVAXpelago as part of its warpath for domination in the northern hemisphere. Many independent nations capitulated and puppet governments were put in its place.

											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium imp-medium">
											<h3>life under occupation</h3>
											<p>	
												It has been over 10 years since the invasion and the people of AVAXpelago are growing restless. Life under the puppet regime has been difficult for the people and talks of a resistance to overthrow the occupying forces is spreading across the whole archipelago region. 
												Many look to the good old days where the people of AVAXpelago had fair representation and freedom to do as they like. But some are looking at this opportunity to get ahead and ensure they have a place in the independent AVAXpelago region. 
											</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium imp-medium">
											<h3>Opportunity and Adventure</h3>
											<p>
												The political turmoil is making AVAXpelago a hot spot for mercenaries, pirates and freelance fleets looking to make a fortune offering their services to the highest bidder or plundering the lands in the chaos.
												Will you help AVAXpelago find freedom from its FIAT shackles? Will you profit from the chaos? Or will you seek to be in a position of power after the chaos? AVAXpelago awaits!

			<!-- Roadmap--> 
			<section id="main2">
				<div class="container">
						<h2 class="major"><span>Roadmap Overhauled</span></h2>
						<h3>Islands Rush</h3>
						<p>
							Islands NFT (ERC 721) tokens were released out to the public as artisan NFTs in a series of land sales. A prototype combat simulation game operated on the <a href="https://discord.islandsofavax.com">Discord</a> channel where players earned rewards through participating in a series of games. Storyline lays out how AVAXpelago became occupied by FIATland forces.
							A portion of the presale proceeds will be put into an interest yielding platform (eg. AAVE/CRV etc...) to generate monthly allowance to pay out in game rewards.
						</p>
						<h3>Islands of Resistance (Combat Simulation)</h3>
						<p>
							AVAXpelago is under FIATland occupation and resistance is in the air. Players take advantage of the chaos as mercenary captains offering their ships to impact the outcome of the war for liberation. 
							A combat simulation is released consisting of military bases (ERC721), military units (ERC20) and resources (ERC20). Players commit their naval units to story based missions to accumulate resources needed in this phase of the game. 											 
							Upon a number of major victories against occupying FIATland forces, the people of AVAXpelago finally achieves their freedom. Players who contributed the most will have a say in shaping the liberated region and the vaule it holds. 
							Will the liberated region seek to be an egalitarian utopian or impenetrable police state? What governance style will it have? How will the government manage its treasury? You decide! 
						</p> 
						<h3>Post Occupation AVAXpelago (Basic Economic Simulation)</h3>
						<p>
							While FIATland is no longer occupying AVAXpelago, expect waves of retailation as they try to retake the region. 
							Military supplies gameplay is unlocked at this stage where players can providing food and supplies (ERC20 tokens) to the AVAXpelago armed forces.
							The leaders of the newly liberated nation state must decide on different policies from taxes to trade and foreign relations.   
						</p> 

						<h3>A New Dawn (Economic Simulation)</h3>
						<p>
							More complex economic simluation is unlocked (civilian & economic infrastructures). Raw resources can be used to construct civilian buildings. 
							Landplots can be claimed by urban island holders and be used for constructing civilian infrastructures. 
							More opportunites for players to find their place and build a business empire in AVAXpelago within the resource & civilian economy. 
							More governance aspect available for players in governance roles. 
						</p> 
						<h3>Sword of Damocles (Stretch goal)</h3>
						<p>
							Introducing a geo political gameplay similar to the boardgame RISK where factions/player teams can become their own nation states with their own DAO cashflow. Engage in diplomacy with other nation states that are connected by the economic and combat simulation game. 
							Embark on a mission for world domination and lay claim on the DAO allowances (Taxes) of other nation states.  
						</p>
						<h3>Expansion to cross chains (Stretch goal)</h3>
						<p>
							Expansion to other chains to allow chain vs chain gameplay. Each chain/network represents a nation filled with thousands of players on each side.
							Imagine leading the AVAX island region and fighting off invaders from a war mongering ETH chain nation while building up an alliance with the BSC chain nation to retailate via a trade embargo.

					<h2 class="major"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
					<div class="container">
						<button class="accordion">What is Island of AVAX?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Islands of AVAX goes beyond just a NFT with islands. It is an economic and combat simluation featuring player driven island nations and fleets. Players collect islands and shipyards to amass their fleet of ships to partake in naval engagements and win rewards. Players may form their own player driven nation states and manage nation state like a mini DAO.
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">How much can I make in Island of AVAX?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							<strong>Note that Islands of AVAX NFT series is first and foremost an artistic NFT collection of islands and <u>not an investment or security of any form.</u></strong> 
							Players who participate in the simulation do so because they love the NFT arts and want to be part of the economic simulation that goes with it. 
							One should not be expecting to make any returns from this game. 
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">How complex is the economic simulation?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							There are two components within Islands of AVAX, an economic simulation and a combat simulation. 
							Under the economic simulation, players build up their business empire through collecting islands, workers and resource extraction facilities. Each month they receive in game resource units based on their economic output. 
							The combat simulation adds in an additional level of gameplay where players must defend their business assets from other players. Failure to do so may result in your resource output being diverted to an occupying team. 
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What are Resource Units (RU)? How do I get them?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Resource Units are ERC20 tokens representing in game resources. $RU are used for building facities, upgrades and acquiring naval vessels within the archipelago region. Players may accumulate $RU through economic activity or through naval activities. 
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What are governor roles? How do I become a governor?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The archipelago region is divided into 20 districts of 100 islands each. Each district has a district capital where the District Governor (DG) resides in. 
							Whoever owns the district capital becomes the DG and can set the policies within the district from taxes and amenities which impacts the RU output for each player. 
							After the Sword of Damocles update, districts become their own player driven nation state and the holder of the capital NFT can engage in diplomacy with other nations. 
							Waging war on another nation can result in increasing the RU output for the nation's players and leader at the expense of the defeated nation.
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What happens after 2000 islands are minted?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The game started off with a limit of 2000 islands but this cap can be adjusted should the council of governors vote to start an expedition to explore new lands (New islands granted to the most supportive districts.). 
							Alternatively, industrialists can fund a private expedition through minting component expedition NFTs in their manufacturing plants. (New islands granted to the industrialists based on component contribution.) 
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Who are the people behind the Islands of AVAX?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The team behind the Islands of AVAX are crypto fanatics and gamers at heart. 
							We are huge fans of economic simulations (Eg. Sim City, Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic, Civilization, Hearts of Iron etc...) and believe that the blockchain is the next playing field for some of our favourite games out there.
							We want to go beyond making NFTs with zero backstory and create the ultimate story driven economic simulation game ever made. We welcome inputs from players and may even recruit the most active players to be part of our advisory committee.
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What happend to the original gameplan?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The game had to pivot after encountering a number of developmental roadblocks. The departure of the developer as a result of his unvested share losing 90% value did not help the siutation at all. 
							Fortunately we were able to find another dev to fill in for us with a transitory game. 
							We are more interested in getting a working game out there instead of making everyone wait years for a final game. 
						</p>
						</div>


						<button class="accordion">Is it true that there's a story and players can particiapte in it?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Every NFT collection has a story, however most project teams abandon the story after minting. 
							Being gamers and Roleplayers at heart, we believe in co-writing the story with the players. 
							The archipelago region is full of wonders and mysteries as well as the surrounding neighbouring regions.  
							<br>
							<br>
							From time to time, players will be asked to vote on major decisions which will unravel the plot further and further. 
							While governors can affect some of the story line, we also have events and stories for players and player groups. 
							There will also be global challenges and storylines where any players can make a contribution and impact.    
							We encourage players to form conglomerates and trading guilds to experience the storyline together.
